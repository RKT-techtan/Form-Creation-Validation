Welcome to the “Deep Dive into JavaScript” project! In this project, you will develop a user registration form with validation and fetch user data from a public API. This project will enhance your understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

You will learn how to:

Validate form inputs using JavaScript.
Dynamically interact with HTML elements.
Fetch and display data from a public API.
Provide real-time feedback to users.
By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students should be able to:

Implement Form Validation:

Understand and implement basic form validation using JavaScript.
Ensure user inputs meet specified criteria before form submission.
Work with the DOM:

Use DOM manipulation to dynamically interact with HTML elements.
Understand and utilize event listeners for form submission and input validation.
Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs:

Use JavaScript to fetch data asynchronously from a public API.
Display fetched data dynamically on a webpage.
Handle potential errors during data fetching.
Enhance User Experience:

Provide real-time feedback to users for form validation.
Ensure data persists across browser sessions using local storage.

PROJECTS CREATED:
1. JavaScript
(a.) File: index.html, style.css, script.js

          Implement a form validation script using basic JavaScript string methods and conditions. Upon form submission, validate the input fields for username, email, and password according to specific criteria. Display a success message if all validations pass, or appropriate error messages if any validations fail.

(b.) File: fetch-data.html, fetch-data.css, fetch-data.js

          You` will write JavaScript code to asynchronously fetch user data from a public API and display each user’s name on a web page. Your code will also handle potential errors during the fetch operation.
